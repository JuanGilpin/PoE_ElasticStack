# PoE_ElasticStack
Read client PoE file, parse and output to Docker Elastic Stack

Visual Studio 2019
- I have included the bin/Debug build I ran locally
    - If you run ES on localhost:9200 and have PoE installed at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile it should all just run if you execute the Exiled.TestConsoleHarness.exe application

- ElasticSearch v6.5.4
